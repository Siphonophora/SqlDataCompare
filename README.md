# Sql Data Compare

This application provides a simple, free option for generating Sql Server scripts which you can then run to compare data returned by any two sql queries. Those queries may be a single select statement using one or more tables, or they be more complex and involve temp tables or common table expressions. It performs equally well at comparing the contents of two tables (including across databases or servers) or validating that refactoring a complex query has not changed the results it returns.

The app is available [on the web][webapp] or you can run it locally.

The script will produce a report like the one below, if all the rows are identical. Or if discrepancies are found, a longer report will detail all the discrepancies. See the [Usage Guide](docs/usage_guide.md) for more details.
